# Disk Space Desklet
- displays the usage of a filesystem, swap or RAM
- thick, thin and compact design

## Installation
- please make sure the "Ubuntu" font is installed

## Remote File System
You can also monitor a remote filesystem (via SSH/SMB). You only need to mount the filesystem from within your file manager (e.g. Nemo) and set the "Filesystem to be monitored" in the desklet seetings to the mount point of the remote file system.
